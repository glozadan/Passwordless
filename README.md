# Passwordless

This is an app that allows a user to be registered using a username, email and password. This information is required for security purposes, since inside the app the user will be able to save the login information of the apps they use in their daily life. The app was created to avoid the need of remembering uncountable usernames and passwords.

The user will be able to register, edit their information and delete account.

On the other hand, every user can safely save the username, passwords, and account description of the accounts they commonly use such as email, and social media. From every account, the user is able to save the account information, visualize and edit it, and if wanted they can also delete the account's information.
